## 📌 Why I Built This

I created this project to reinforce my AWS knowledge and simulate real exam conditions. Despite having **basic coding experience**, I was able to build a fully functional quiz tool with the guidance of ChatGPT.

This project represents both a **learning milestone** and a **reusable resource** for myself and others preparing for the AWS SA-Associate exam.
